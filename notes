- Initial setup
- OPLog is just a dummy package with permission tags for OOS Camera
- Xpos is the xposed module which hooks onto the setvendor method to make sure that the cam doesn't crash
- Camera cannot open normally, getting some serialized shit error
- Pro mode works okish
- Switching modes crashes app
